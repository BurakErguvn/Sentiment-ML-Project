28,"This place is pathetic. Every time I order at the drive thru they make me park up and wait. Today I waited 20 mins and when my food arrived, it was stone cold. I asked them to replace it, waited a further 15 mins, eventually I got out of the car and went inside to find out what was going on, they had forgotten about me and quickly scrambled around to get my order together. I've just got home and one of the burgers is stone cold and rock solid. I'm fuming.",Negative
