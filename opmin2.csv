0,"Everything was of top standard, nothing too much trouble, the decor throughout was lovely, clean and well maintained Ali on reception, Chris with valet parking and Stephan our waiter were all exceptional hosts and made our stay most memorable, including a birthday cake in our room and a candle desert after dinner, all personal to us, thank you all",Positive
1,"This place is pathetic. Every time I order at the drive thru they make me park up and wait. Today I waited 20 mins and when my food arrived, it was stone cold. I asked them to replace it, waited a further 15 mins, eventually I got out of the car and went inside to find out what was going on, they had forgotten about me and quickly scrambled around to get my order together. I've just got home and one of the burgers is stone cold and rock solid. I'm fuming.",Negative
2,"The staff went above and beyond at all times, from suggesting restaurants and then securing a table for us. The room was perfect.",Positive
3,"The food was delicious, a wonderful tour of local specialities with excellent presentation. Each course was well balanced, great textures and flavours. We particularly enjoyed the atmosphere, which was more informal than expected. Christophe came to the table to take our order himself. He has a really lovely character and made us felt at ease and respected. This is reflected in his staff as well, who are incredibly professional and clearly take pride in their work while remaining very personable.",Positive
4,I called for a quote. They told me they would show up the next day to provide the quote. I waited and they never showed up or provided any explanation for no showing or any further follow up. Very unprofessional and unreliable company. 0/5. Would not recommend.,Negative
5,My wife and I stayed at Maison a cote in May 2014 and had a pleasantly surprisingly amazing dinner at the restaurant. Chef Christophe had recently purchased the place and we had a lovely conversation about food and his time in New York. I remember telling him that his food is Michelin Star worthy and I am so happy to see that he has 2 Michelin start. Some day I will be back to indulge in his amazing gastronomical delight again. Congrats chef. Wish the best for the 3rd star and for making it to #7 on this list.,Positive
6,I bought a bag from here. The quality is remarkable.It's well worth the money for their high-quality products; I highly recommended!,Positive
7,"I finally booked a cleaner as I am a mom with a lot on the go and felt some house keeping would go a long way in helping with my mental state! I was so looking forward to having my house deep cleaned and a starting fresh for the fall, but never even received a clean as the person who was scheduled through this company wasn't here 1.5 hours after our scheduled time of 11am! No body even reached out to me in that time frame. I called them myself to confirm on the one hour late mark, and again to cancel 30 mins later. Do not book this company if you are someone who appreciates punctuality.",Negative
8,"Completely incompetent tree care service. They cut off large, healthy branches, whilst leaving the unproductive, dried shoots on the tree. The act defied all common sense. Any qualified arborist knows that you do not prune ANY tree in the spring or summer. They are meant to be pruned during dormant season in order to minimizes the risk of fungus infection or insect infestation. Dead branches can be removed at any time, however as mentioned, healthy, fully living branches were being cut off. They left all the trees on our property lopsided and with dead branches still attached, while the healthy, living ones were on the grass. Would never recommend them!",Negative

10,"I ordered the value Pk (which is supposed to include a gallon, a 32 oz. and a spray nozzle). for $65.99 on July 3rd 2020. I recieved just the 32 oz. bottle in a Fed-Ex medium box. I reached out to the company several times and have gotten nowhere. Every time I call they take my name and info and have done nothing to rectify the situation.",Negative
11,"Rather than using a standard marketing automation tool, we switched to Salesforce Marketing Cloud. Besides its powerful automation feature, it is also tightly integrated with Salesforce CRM. Sending personalized marketing campaigns is breeze with Salesforce Marketing Cloud.",Positive
12,"To segment the data, Working knowledge of SQL is required. Integration of GTM and API's is heavily reliant on tech team.",Negative
13,"Finally an easy to use, all in one product - being developed for the average person. Extremely reasonable fees and a responsive developer team. THIS in my opinion will disrupt the otherwise utterly monopolized crypto wallet market.",Positive
14,This app is going to explode.,Positive
15,Watch your pockets before you deal with these guys. They'll quote you one thing on the phone and then jack up the price once they are actually there.,Negative
16,This company used to be pretty good but the last year has been awful!! I get screwed around every month when they either dont show up or change the time the night before or morning of. I've had to take pictures numerous times of very obvious things they miss and this last time I asked for my money back Do not hire this company!!,Negative
17,"Would not hire this company ever! No response, have been waiting weeks. Found another handyman that actually CALLED ME BACK!!",Negative
